# hello-world
There is really nothing I would rather do  
I'm so happy just to branch with You

So I've been using Github the quick and dirty way,  
not knowing much about it for ohh so long,  
but now I've decided, this has to end,  
I've got to get a grip and understand.  

What makes Github, Gihub, how does it work?
What is pull request, what is a fork?
Why should one bother, ain't it all the same?  
In the end we'll just push it, It's all just a game.  

Alas, I was wrong, the same it is not,  
version control, Coding spaces and whole lot else,  
I still now know not.
However I'm determined to learn. Hence this rhyme is here now Bj√∂rn.
